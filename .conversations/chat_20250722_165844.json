      "content": "Based on the responses provided, I can synthesize the following comprehensive answer about the main claimed accomplishments in the DeepSeek technical report:\n\nThe DeepSeek-V3 technical report highlights several significant accomplishments:\n\n1. **Large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Model**: DeepSeek-V3 is a 671B parameter MoE language model that activates 37B parameters per token. This open-source model achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models.\n\n2. **Efficient Training and Inference**: The model utilizes Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures for efficient inference and cost-effective training. The total training time was only 2.788M H800 GPU hours, with remarkable stability.\n\n3. **Novel Training Strategies**: The report introduces an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and a multi-token prediction training objective, both aimed at improving overall performance.\n\n4. **Benchmark Performance**: DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other open-source models on various benchmarks (e.g., MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, MATH 500, AIME 2024, Codeforces, SWE-bench Verified), achieving competitive results with closed-source models like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5.\n\n5. **Public Availability**: The model checkpoints are publicly available on GitHub.\n\nAdditionally, a separate technical report on Native Sparse Attention (NSA), which appears to be part of the DeepSeek ecosystem, claims two main accomplishments:\n\n6. **Speed Improvements**: NSA achieves substantial speedups over Full Attention across decoding, forward propagation, and backward propagation, particularly for long sequences (64k-length).\n\n7. **Comparable Performance with End-to-End Trainability**: NSA maintains or surpasses the performance of Full Attention models across various benchmarks while allowing for end-to-end training, which reduces pretraining computation costs.\n\nIt's important to note that the responses provided contain information from multiple sources, some of which are not directly related to DeepSeek. The synthesis focuses on the information specifically pertaining to DeepSeek's technical reports.\n\nThe reports do not explicitly mention major limitations or caveats, other than the implicit understanding that DeepSeek-V3's performance is comparable to, but not necessarily exceeding, leading closed-source models. Further details on limitations might be found in the full, untruncated reports.",
