      "response": "The provided text focuses on skip lists, a data structure, and does not contain information about distributed systems.  Therefore, I cannot answer your question using the given excerpt.  The excerpt describes the implementation and analysis of skip lists, including concepts like logarithmic time complexity, randomization for balancing, and the use of the randomized reduction lemma for analysis.  However, these are not concepts related to distributed systems.\n",
